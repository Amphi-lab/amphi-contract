## web2 translation company model vs amphi model

**web2 translation company model**

centralized model limit the workload availiable, including transaction, sign contract and coordination efficiency,these lot of things was decided by the PM, actually if there is clear rules, translators can operate by themselves well. so we need to decentralize the power.

**amphi model**

amphi expand the workload limitation. the task will not decide by only the company or the project manager, translator and validator can cooperate well and control the quality well here. normally, translator and validator stand the same side to serve buyer in web2 translation company, amphi's smart contract separate their responsibility that validator should control the quality of translator for  himself/herself, because the under standard quality will affect only validator's revenue not translator's. So the quality will be control between these two party. Additionally, amphi DAO member can vote for the better quality if there is proposal related.

Except business is onchain, we also provide opensource translation intelligent tools.
